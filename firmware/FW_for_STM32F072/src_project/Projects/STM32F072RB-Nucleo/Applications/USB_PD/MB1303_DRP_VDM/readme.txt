@par Example Description 

Add here a detailled but simple description of the example. this description will be
reused inside the application note which list all the example. This paragraph end when
a "." is at the end of a line like the following one ==> .

Add here the behavior of the example.
It is free text.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Keywords

Add here all the importants words of the example separated by "," + USB_PD MB1303_DRP_VDM
USB_PD, MB1303_DRP_VDM, Security, IEC 60870-5, hardware CRC,

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STUSB1602 devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
